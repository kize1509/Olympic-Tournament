# Olympic Basketball Tournament Simulator 🏀

A Node.js-based simulation of an Olympic basketball tournament. The project predicts and simulates tournament outcomes using historical data and probability-based methods, enabling realistic outcomes for matches and final rankings.

---

## 🌟 Features

### **Simulation Core**
- **Team Data Input**: Includes team statistics, previous match results, and scores.
- **Probability-Based Predictions**: Outcomes are simulated using:
  - Historical win/loss records.
  - Point differentials.
  - Head-to-head results.
- **Dynamic Tournament Structure**: Simulates group and knockout stages dynamically.

### **Tournament Workflow**
1. **Group Stage Simulation**: Simulates round-robin matches and generates standings.
2. **Knockout Stage Simulation**: Runs quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, determining a winner.
3. **Result Reporting**: Outputs detailed match results and team rankings.

### **Statistical Insights**
- **Probability Analysis**: Provides probabilities for team advancement and wins.
- **Historical Comparison**: Compares simulation outcomes to actual historical results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/olympic-basketball-simulator.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

cd olympic-basketball-simulator

Install dependencies:

    npm install
    # or
    yarn install

🔧 Usage

    Prepare Input Data:
        Place exibitions and group data in the data/ folder:
            exibitions.json
            groups.json

    Configure Settings:
        Modify tournament settings in the config/ folder.

    Run the Simulation:

    npm start

    View Results:
        Match outcomes and rankings are displayed in the console or saved to the output/ folder.

🧠 How It Works

    Data Preparation:
        Teams and match data are loaded from the data/ folder.
        Team strength is calculated based on historical data (e.g., win rates, point differentials).

    Simulation Logic:
        Each match is simulated probabilistically, considering:
            Team strength.
            Previous encounters.
            Random variations.

    Tournament Stages:
        Group Stage: Round-robin simulation where all teams compete in groups.
        Knockout Stage: Winners progress through elimination rounds until the final.

    Results Output:
        Standings, match scores, and probability distributions are generated.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
    Libraries:
        fs (File System): For reading and writing data files.
        mathjs or custom utility: For probability calculations.
        commander: For handling CLI inputs (if applicable).
